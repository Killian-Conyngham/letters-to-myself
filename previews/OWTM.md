# On Writing Too Much

I think I was writing too much.

It’s a weird thing to say. Especially seeing as only a week ago I would have told you it was the main thing I was proud of about from my time in China. And to be clear, I'm still happy I did it. I would never even know any of this otherwise.

But I am begining to realise it was too much. 

At some point I started placing too much importance in the words and the pieces and writing to write. Which is fine. But it also feels hollow somehow. 

Just looking at a piece and thinking about what would ‘work well’ or ‘make sense’ or ‘flow naturally’. Writer stuff.

But I don't think I want to write like that. Not really. Or if I do I want it to at least be for something externally important. Certainly not just for my own ego.

The way I want to write, which in fairness was the genesis of all of this, is as an *inescapable* byproduct of living.

Pieces and ideas and sentences concocted in the throws of the intense emotions that explode out of the basic acts existence and observation.  
Feelings and thoughts that linger and ping pong around my brain incessantly until they are bottled up and excreted onto the page.  
   
I’m not sure if all that will make sense, so I’ll give an example. There's a piece I'm writing. The centrepiece of all this really. It's about decisions and narratives, and why they scare me so much. It's a decent piece, I'd like to think. And yet, when I reread it now it feels hollow. Less like bottled lightning and more like a manufactured movie. Overly focused and overly polished such that the purpose is lost rather than refined. At some point I started coming into each paragraph knowing what it has to be so that the next one makes sense. Which might sound perfectly logical. But I can imagine no worse fate. Something there has intrinsically been lost. When readability takes precedence to unpacking the thoughts themselves. I am no longer in dialogue with the page infront of me. Instead I am veering off course into delusiona of imagined audiences and their imagined impressions. And in fear of their made up consternation I am no longer searching for truth in myself. The noble pursuit has been replaced by a lifeless idea of what I believe others might think writing should be.

And that shines through, I think. Rereading the sections in question I find them absolutely unnoteworthy. And in being so they make me question why I even write at all. It can't just be about moulding sentences into pretty forms for the sake of impressing people. Call me melodramatic but its important to me that genuine belief comes first and writing comes second. I am hardly the first to have these thoughts of course. Art should be authentic. *Wow. How did I possibly come up with that one.* It is hardly a novel insight. In Kae Tempest’s brilliant ‘On Connection’ they write  how this writing thing is and should be a process of desperately trying to turn the ethereal thoughts into clumsy imperfect pieces. I have nothing new to offer here, just old ideas recycled through my particular prism of experience. But right now this thought feels particularly pertinent and right now I really am talking to the page. Each sentence is getting scritinised not based on how someone else might perceive it but based on whether it rings true. This is the type of writing that makes me do all this nonsense in the first place. That fuels much of my life really. I’ve just been driving it away recently, and spending far too much time rearranging words without sufficient conviction.  
   
Come to think of it, I can put it even more broadly: I have not just been writing, but thinking too much recently. I've been lost in this world of becoming a writer or doing a PhD or finding a wife or starting a commune or whatever else. I have spent so much time alone thinking about it all and trying to figure it out. Which is great, don't get me wrong. But even with all that thinking I didn't come to many conclusions. Or I did. But I kept thinking and started questioning them, came to new conclusions and started questioning those too. And repeated the cycle until nothing felt real or sure. Such that essentially, at the end of the process, all that remained was added uncertainty and a growing sense that all these questions were **really important** and had to be resolved straight away. It's no wonder I am back to levels of anxiety I haven’t felt since my undergrad.

I think I just need to remember that all these questions, these topics I write and think about, they are all important stuff. But they are not solvable. There is no unquestionably right answer to be found at the end of all the thinking. Not for me and not for anyone else. In the eternity of the here and now all one can do is live and try their best. So that's what I suggest to you now. Go take a break from reading and thinking and all these silly words I have concocted and live your life. I've taken enough of your time.
