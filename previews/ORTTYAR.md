## On Revisitations and This Thing You Are Reading
"[...]

So what you are reading now is a very similar collection of essays on topics, written to prove I still can, and to get back in touch with myself, whatever that might entail. But this time it really is explicitly and openly for myself. It is the manual of thoughts for creating a Killian. The true and updated rebooting guide should I ever find myself in a whistless slump again where I have, even if only partially, forgotten who I am. Or, more realistically, a curious artefact for myself and others who care enough to look back on and read and think: ‘Wow, those sure are some thoughts.’

And its creation will also, I hope, serve as an exploration. Most of the themes I want to write about are not ones on which I need to preserve my current thoughts, but precisely those where I have not nailed things down on yet. And, more generally, few prospects excite me more, than delving into topics, seeking out guidance and wisdom, untangling my own thoughts and other’s insights and wrapping it all in a meandering essay. So sitting here now, at the start of this project, I have no idea where I will end up. I’m hoping for somewhere new and old and familiar and challenging.  But we’ll see. I truly have no idea. And that is great.

Because the secret is, I am more than anything hoping to be wrong. To contradict much of what is written here by the end. Or ignore the prescriptions altogether. And I am hoping that any of the lovely people who take the time to read all this nonsense will be kind enough to share where and how exactly they find mistakes and contradictions themselves. Or maybe where they just plain disagree. If I am truly going to chart where exactly my head is at on topics of such importance to me, there is no worse fate I can think of than for those conclusions to be left unchallenged and stagnant and stale.

So I hope you enjoy these musings. Whether you are me in the future or a trusted friend or someone else entirely who happened upon this by some strange coincidence. I hope you enjoy the sentences and think about them and disagree with them and write me impassioned letters about them. Because as someone sorting his thoughts and convictions out right now and cramming them into these imperfect words, I feel obliged to tell you this: it is an absolutely fantastic feeling.
