# On (not) Writing and Audiences of One
"[...]

And that, really, is the new motivation that I want to use to fuel my creative fire. Not the imaginary adoration of imaginary fans. But a real, genuine: ‘I liked that, it made me think some thoughts and inspired me to do some writing of my own’ from a dear friend. That’s the target I am shooting for. The why I am ascribing to all this self-indulgent nonsense. The north star, towards which I will use any feedback I receive to head. And once that motivation runs out, once I get the sense the work I share is actually only being read to indulge me, or maybe once someone finally has the courage to say as much to my face, I will return to focusing my rambles on far more unhinged journal entries which really and truly are for my eyes only. It’s much less work that way anyway. 

For now though, I will endeavour onwards, sinking untold hours of my life into these pages. I will stay open to feedback and signals if someone thinks I am on the wrong path, but I will choose to believe, even if it just self-placation, that I am doing this all for a reason. I suppose there is no way of knowing whether such a decision is objectively correct. That is part of the unbearable lightness of being. But choosing to write recently, and to write a lot, has certainly felt pretty damn great.

Not many people have read the things I have written, and not many will. That is fine. Because the people who do, who have and who will matter to me. And if even some of them take joy in these words, well I’d say that is enough. That’s about all the motivation I need. Now I just need to sit down and get writing."
