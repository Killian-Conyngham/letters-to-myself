# On Love and Polyamory
The fact is that this loving thing is hard. And I undeniably have a lot to learn still. A lot more mistakes to make and lessons to learn the hard way. So I suppose this topic could just remain as one which fills the pages of my journal, and conversation with friends, and rarely appears anywhere else. Because I have no idea what I'm doing. I donâ€™t know if anyone does. Who and how I love is perhaps one of the singularly most important choices I will ever make. How can you possible expect me to say with any definitive clarity that I know what I am doing, much less commit it to written words that people including myself might one day look back on and laugh at for their inaccuracies? No, it is much safer not to leave it all vague, keep the definitive statements to late night chats and my diary and call it a day.

And I could end this here. I really could. Radically open and undetermined. 

But that would be falling right back into the old ways. 

So instead I will say this:  
I **do** know some things about love.  Not perhaps any sort of usable advice for anyone else. But things worth committing to paper for myself.  
I know that love is incredible.  
I know that caring for someone, really caring for someone, will always open me up to the potential for immense pain.  
I know to be truthful and to be kind because there is no other way.  
I know to follow my gut and my heart, with a healthy measure of brain when needed.  
I know to be forgiving, trusting and ultimately naive is to be truly brave.  
And I know that every single fucking second since I remembered the term unconditional love, it has gnawed at me like a rat in a lead bowl.

So fuck it. Who cares that it is a nuclear bomb with the power to destroy me emotionally once again. Who cares that some old people say real love should be measured and deliberate, not impulsive and emotional. Who cares that I was hurt before and coddled myself with never again. There is simply too much on the line not to try. And I am going to try with every bloody bone in my body and every muscle in my heart.  
And I am no longer scared to put that down in words.
